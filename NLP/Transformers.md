# Transformer Models in NLP

## Introduction to Transformers

### "Attention Is All You Need" Paper:
The Transformer model was introduced in the seminal paper **"Attention Is All You Need"** by Vaswani et al. (Google Brain) in 2017. This paper marked a significant paradigm shift in sequence modeling for NLP.

### Motivation:
Traditional sequence models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, and GRUs process sequences token by token, sequentially. This sequential nature poses challenges:
-   **Limited Parallelization:** The computation for a token depends on the hidden state of the previous token, making it difficult to parallelize computations within a sequence.
-   **Long-Range Dependencies:** While LSTMs and GRUs were designed to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, capturing very long-range dependencies effectively remained challenging. Path lengths for information flow are proportional to sequence length.

Transformers aimed to overcome these limitations by **relying entirely on attention mechanisms** to draw global dependencies between input and output, without using any recurrent layers.

### Parallelization Capabilities:
Since Transformers do not rely on sequential recurrence (within a layer), computations for all tokens in a sequence can be performed largely in parallel, significantly speeding up training, especially on modern hardware like GPUs and TPUs.

## Overall Architecture (Encoder-Decoder Structure)

The original Transformer model follows an **encoder-decoder architecture**, similar to those used in RNN-based sequence-to-sequence models, but composed of Transformer-specific blocks.

-   **Encoder Stack:** The encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (e.g., word embeddings) `(x_1, ..., x_n)` to a sequence of continuous representations `z = (z_1, ..., z_n)`.
-   **Decoder Stack:** Given `z`, the decoder then generates an output sequence `(y_1, ..., y_m)` of symbols one element at a time. At each step, the model is auto-regressive, consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.

-   **High-level Diagram:**
    ```
    Input Sequence --> Input Embedding --> Positional Encoding --> [ENCODER BLOCK] x N --> Encoder Output
                                                                        ^      |
                                                                        |      V (Keys, Values)
    Output Sequence --> Output Embedding --> Positional Encoding --> [DECODER BLOCK] x N --> Output Probabilities
    (shifted right)                                                     (Queries)
    ```
-   **Usage:** This architecture is well-suited for tasks like machine translation (translating a sentence from one language to another), text summarization, and question answering.

## Encoder

The encoder is a stack of `N` identical layers. Each layer has two main sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.

### 1. Input Embedding:
-   The input tokens (words or subwords) are first converted into dense vector representations using standard word embedding techniques (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, or learned embeddings).
-   Dimension of embeddings: `d_model`.

### 2. Positional Encoding:
-   **Why it's needed:** Unlike RNNs, Transformers do not have an inherent notion of sequence order because self-attention mechanisms treat the input as a set of vectors, losing positional information. To make use of the order of the sequence, information about the relative or absolute position of tokens must be injected.
-   **Methods:**
    -   **Sine/Cosine Functions (Original Paper):** Fixed positional encodings using sine and cosine functions of different frequencies.
        `PE(pos, 2i)   = sin(pos / 10000^(2i / d_model))`
        `PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^(2i / d_model))`
        Where `pos` is the position of the token in the sequence, `i` is the dimension index within the embedding vector, and `d_model` is the embedding dimension. This allows the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset `k`, `PE(pos+k)` can be represented as a linear function of `PE(pos)`.
    -   **Learned Positional Embeddings:** Alternatively, positional embeddings can be learned during training, similar to word embeddings.
-   The positional encodings have the same dimension `d_model` as the embeddings and are added element-wise to the input embeddings.

### 3. Multi-Head Self-Attention:
This is the core component that allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence when encoding a particular word.

-   **Self-Attention (Scaled Dot-Product Attention):**
    -   An attention mechanism where **Queries (Q)**, **Keys (K)**, and **Values (V)** all come from the same source: the output of the previous layer in the encoder.
    -   For each token in the input sequence, we create a Query vector, a Key vector, and a Value vector. These are typically created by multiplying the input embedding (plus positional encoding) by three separate learned weight matrices (`W_Q`, `W_K`, `W_V`).
    -   The attention score is calculated between the Query vector of a token and the Key vectors of all other tokens (including itself) in the sequence.
    -   **Formula:** `Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax( (QK^T) / sqrt(d_k) ) V`
        -   `Q`, `K`, `V` are matrices packing together the query, key, and value vectors for all tokens.
        -   `d_k` is the dimension of the key vectors (and query vectors). The scaling factor `sqrt(d_k)` is used to prevent the dot products from growing too large, which could lead to vanishing gradients in the softmax function.
        -   The `softmax` is applied row-wise to the `QK^T` matrix, producing attention weights.
        -   The output is a weighted sum of the Value vectors, where the weights are the attention scores. This output vector for each token captures contextual information from the entire sequence.

-   **Multi-Head Mechanism:**
    -   Instead of performing a single attention function with `d_model`-dimensional Q, K, V, Transformers use multiple "attention heads."
    -   The Q, K, and V vectors are linearly projected `h` times (number of heads) using different, learned weight matrices, resulting in `h` sets of lower-dimensional Q, K, V vectors (typically `d_k = d_v = d_model / h`).
    -   Scaled dot-product attention is then applied in parallel to each of these `h` projected versions of Q, K, V.
    -   The `h` output vectors (one from each head) are concatenated and then projected again with another learned weight matrix `W_O` to produce the final output of the multi-head attention layer. This output has the dimension `d_model`.
    -   **Formula:** `MultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head_1, ..., head_h) W_O`
        where `head_i = Attention(Q W_Q_i, K W_K_i, V W_V_i)`
    -   **Benefits:**
        -   Allows the model to **jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.** For example, one head might focus on syntactic relationships, while another focuses on semantic similarity.
        -   Increases the model's capacity to capture diverse types of relationships.

### 4. Add & Norm Layer:
Each sub-layer (Multi-Head Self-Attention or Feed-Forward Network) in the encoder has a residual connection around it, followed by layer normalization.
-   **Residual Connection:** The output of the sub-layer is `x + Sublayer(x)`. This helps in training deep networks by allowing gradients to flow more easily through the network (mitigating vanishing gradients).
-   **Layer Normalization:** `LayerNorm(input)`. Normalizes the activations across the features for a given instance, which stabilizes training and speeds up convergence.
-   The combined operation is: `output = LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x))`

### 5. Feed-Forward Network (Position-wise FFN):
-   This is a fully connected feed-forward network applied to each position (each token's representation) separately and identically. It consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.
-   **Formula:** `FFN(x) = max(0, xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2`
    -   `x` is the output from the Add & Norm layer after self-attention.
    -   `W_1`, `b_1`, `W_2`, `b_2` are learned parameters.
    -   The input and output dimensionality is `d_model`. The inner-layer dimensionality is typically larger (e.g., `d_ff = 4 * d_model`).
-   This FFN allows the model to process the information learned by the attention mechanism in a more complex way and adds non-linearity.

### Stacking Encoder Layers:
The encoder typically consists of `N` (e.g., N=6 in the original paper) identical layers stacked on top of each other. The output of one encoder layer becomes the input to the next.

## Decoder

The decoder also consists of a stack of `N` identical layers. Its structure is similar to the encoder, but with crucial modifications to handle the generation of the output sequence.

### 1. Output Embedding:
-   The target sequence tokens (shifted right, meaning the decoder input at step `t` is the target token `y_{t-1}`) are converted to embeddings.

### 2. Positional Encoding:
-   Same as in the encoder, added to the output embeddings to provide sequence order information.

### 3. Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention:
-   This is a self-attention mechanism applied to the decoder's input sequence (the already generated output tokens).
-   **Masking:** Crucially, the self-attention is modified to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. During training, when generating the token at position `i`, the model should only have access to tokens at positions `< i`. This is achieved by adding `-infinity` to the attention scores for future tokens before the softmax, effectively zeroing out their attention weights. This ensures the auto-regressive property (predictions depend only on known outputs).

### 4. Add & Norm Layer:
-   Applied after the masked multi-head self-attention sub-layer.

### 5. Multi-Head Encoder-Decoder Attention:
-   This is the layer where the decoder interacts with the encoder's output.
-   **Queries (Q):** Come from the output of the previous decoder layer (the masked multi-head self-attention sub-layer).
-   **Keys (K) and Values (V):** Come from the **output of the encoder stack**. This is where the "attention" to the input sequence happens.
-   This mechanism allows the decoder, at each step of generating an output token, to attend to the most relevant parts of the input sequence.
-   The computations (scaled dot-product, multi-head) are similar to the self-attention, but Q comes from the decoder and K, V come from the encoder.

### 6. Add & Norm Layer:
-   Applied after the encoder-decoder attention sub-layer.

### 7. Feed-Forward Network:
-   Same structure as in the encoder, applied position-wise.

### 8. Add & Norm Layer:
-   Applied after the FFN.

### Stacking Decoder Layers:
Similar to the encoder, `N` identical decoder layers are stacked.

## Final Linear Layer and Softmax

-   After the decoder stack, the output vectors are passed through a final **linear layer** that projects them to the dimensionality of the vocabulary.
-   A **softmax function** is then applied to these scores to produce a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary for the next token to be generated. The token with the highest probability is typically chosen.

## Training Transformers

-   **Optimizer:** Adam optimizer is commonly used, often with a specific **learning rate schedule** that involves a warm-up phase (linearly increasing LR) followed by a decay phase (e.g., inverse square root decay).
-   **Regularization:**
    -   **Dropout:** Applied to the output of each sub-layer before it is added to the sub-layer input (residual connection) and to the sums of the embeddings and positional encodings.
    -   **Label Smoothing:** A technique that reduces model overconfidence by slightly "softening" the target labels (e.g., instead of one-hot [0,0,1,0], use [0.025, 0.025, 0.925, 0.025]).

## Why Transformers are Effective

-   **Parallel Processing:** Computations across tokens within a layer can be done in parallel, leading to faster training compared to the sequential nature of RNNs.
-   **Direct Modeling of Long-Range Dependencies:** Self-attention allows direct connections between any two tokens in a sequence, regardless of their distance. The path length for information flow between any two positions is O(1).
-   **Hierarchical Feature Learning:** Multiple layers allow the model to learn increasingly complex representations of the input. Multi-head attention allows different heads to focus on different types of relationships.

## Popular Transformer-based Models (Brief Overview)

The Transformer architecture has been the foundation for many state-of-the-art NLP models:

-   **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):**
    -   Uses an **encoder-only** architecture.
    -   Pre-trained on two unsupervised tasks:
        -   **Masked Language Model (MLM):** Some percentage of input tokens are masked, and the model predicts the original masked tokens. This allows learning bidirectional context.
        -   **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):** Given two sentences A and B, the model predicts if B is the actual next sentence that follows A.
    -   Fine-tuned for various downstream tasks (classification, NER, QA) by adding a small task-specific layer.
-   **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer):**
    -   Uses a **decoder-only** architecture (essentially a Transformer decoder without the encoder-decoder attention part, only masked self-attention).
    -   Pre-trained using standard **left-to-right language modeling** (predicting the next word given previous words).
    -   Known for its strong text generation capabilities and few-shot/zero-shot learning abilities in larger versions (GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4).
-   **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer):**
    -   Uses the standard encoder-decoder architecture.
    -   Treats **every NLP task as a "text-to-text" problem**, where the input is text and the output is text (e.g., for classification, the output is the class label as a string).
    -   Pre-trained on a massive multi-task dataset (C4 corpus).
-   **Others:**
    -   **RoBERTa:** Optimized BERT pre-training.
    -   **XLNet:** Autoregressive pre-training that learns bidirectional contexts.
    -   **ALBERT:** A Lite BERT for self-supervised learning of language representations.
    -   **BART:** Denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models.

## Advantages of Transformers

-   Achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous NLP benchmarks.
-   Highly parallelizable, leading to efficient training on modern hardware.
-   Excellent at capturing long-range dependencies between tokens in a sequence.
-   Transfer learning through pre-trained models (like BERT, GPT) has become a standard and highly effective approach.

## Disadvantages/Challenges

-   **Computational Complexity:** The self-attention mechanism has a complexity of O(n^2 * d) where `n` is the sequence length and `d` is the representation dimension. This makes it computationally expensive for very long sequences.
-   **Data-Hungry:** Large Transformer models require massive datasets for pre-training to achieve their full potential.
-   **Positional Information:** While positional encodings provide order information, it's sometimes argued that this handling is less "natural" or integrated than in RNNs.
-   **Interpretability:** While attention weights can offer some insight, understanding the exact reasoning of deep Transformer models remains challenging.

## Variations and Extensions (Briefly)

To address the quadratic complexity for long sequences, various "Efficient Transformer" models have been proposed:
-   **Sparse Transformers:** Use sparse attention patterns instead of full attention.
-   **Longformer:** Uses a combination of local windowed attention and global attention.
-   **Reformer:** Uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to approximate attention and reversible residual layers to save memory.

## Libraries

-   **Hugging Face Transformers:** An extremely popular open-source library that provides implementations of thousands of pre-trained Transformer-based models and makes them easy to download and use for various NLP tasks. It supports both PyTorch and TensorFlow.
-   **TensorFlow & PyTorch:** Core deep learning libraries that provide the building blocks (layers, functions) to implement Transformers from scratch or build custom variations.

Transformers have fundamentally changed the landscape of NLP, and their impact continues to grow.
