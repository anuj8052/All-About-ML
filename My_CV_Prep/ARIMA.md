Here's how you can **clearly and confidently explain ARIMA and SARIMA** in an interview — structured and interview-friendly:

---

### ✅ Start with ARIMA:

> **"ARIMA** stands for **AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average**. It's a popular statistical model used for **time series forecasting**.

* **AutoRegressive (AR)** part means the model uses the **past values** of the variable to predict the future.
* **Integrated (I)** refers to **differencing the data** to make it stationary — so trends or seasonality are removed.
* **Moving Average (MA)** uses the **past forecast errors** to improve prediction.

The model is defined by three parameters: **ARIMA(p, d, q)**

* `p`: number of lag observations (AR part)
* `d`: degree of differencing (I part)
* `q`: size of the moving average window (MA part)

It works well when the data **does not have seasonality.**"

---

### ✅ Then move to SARIMA:

> **"SARIMA** extends ARIMA by adding **seasonal components**. It's used when the time series has **seasonal patterns**, like monthly sales or weather data.

It adds four seasonal parameters: **SARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q, s)**
Where:

* `P`, `D`, `Q` are the seasonal counterparts of `p`, `d`, `q`
* `s` is the **seasonal period**, like 12 for monthly data with yearly seasonality

So SARIMA captures both **trend + seasonality** in time series, which makes it more powerful for many real-world forecasting problems."

---

### ✅ Bonus (if asked when to use which):

> “If my data has **no seasonality**, ARIMA works well. But if there is a **clear seasonal cycle**, I prefer SARIMA to capture that pattern. I usually check this with decomposition plots or autocorrelation plots before choosing the model.”
