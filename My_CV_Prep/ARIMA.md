***ARIMA***:
"ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. It's a popular statistical model used for time series forecasting.

AutoRegressive (AR) part means the model uses the past values of the variable to predict the future.

Integrated (I) refers to differencing the data to make it stationary â€” so trends or seasonality are removed.

Moving Average (MA) uses the past forecast errors to improve prediction.

The model is defined by three parameters: ARIMA(p, d, q)

p: number of lag observations (AR part)

d: degree of differencing (I part)

q: size of the moving average window (MA part)

It works well when the data does not have seasonality."
