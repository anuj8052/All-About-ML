### **Activation Functions in Neural Networks**  

Activation functions play a crucial role in neural networks by introducing non-linearity into the model. This allows the network to learn complex patterns and make decisions based on input data. Below is a detailed explanation of commonly used activation functions, including their formulas, examples, and key points.

### **1. Sigmoid Activation Function**
- **Formula**:  
  
  $sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$
  
- **Range**: (0, 1)  
- **Explanation**:
  - The sigmoid function maps input values to a range between 0 and 1.
  - Commonly used in binary classification problems to predict probabilities.
- **Advantages**:
  - Smooth gradient and probabilistic interpretation.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Vanishing gradient problem for very large or small inputs.
  - Outputs are not zero-centered.
- **Example**:
  - Predicting the probability of a customer purchasing a product based on features like income and age.  
  - If \(x = 2\):  
    
    $sigma(2) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-2}} \approx 0.88$
     
    The probability of purchase is 88%.

### **2. Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh)**
- **Formula**:  
  
  $tanh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}$
  
- **Range**: (-1, 1)  
- **Explanation**:
  - Similar to the sigmoid function but outputs values centered around zero.
  - Helps in faster convergence as gradients are zero-centered.
- **Advantages**:
  - Zero-centered outputs.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Suffers from the vanishing gradient problem for very large or small inputs.
- **Example**:
  - In sentiment analysis, tanh can scale sentiment scores to a range between -1 (negative) and 1 (positive).  
  - If \(x = 1\):  
    
    $tanh(1) = \frac{e^1 - e^{-1}}{e^1 + e^{-1}} \approx 0.76$
     
    Sentiment score is 0.76 (positive sentiment).

### **3. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**
- **Formula**:  
  
  $f(x) = \max(0, x)$
  
- **Range**: [0, ∞)  
- **Explanation**:
  - Sets all negative inputs to zero and keeps positive inputs unchanged.
  - Introduces non-linearity while being computationally efficient.
- **Advantages**:
  - Avoids vanishing gradient problems for positive inputs.
  - Simplicity and fast computation.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Can cause dead neurons (outputs stuck at 0 for large portions of the input space).
- **Example**:
  - In image processing, ReLU helps preserve positive pixel values while suppressing noise (negative values).  
  - If \(x = -3\):  
    
    $f(-3) = \max(0, -3) = 0$

### **4. Leaky ReLU**
- **Formula**:  
  
  $f(x) = 
  \begin{cases} 
  x & \text{if } x > 0 \\
  \alpha x & \text{if } x \leq 0
  \end{cases}$
  
  (where \(\alpha\) is a small constant, e.g., 0.01)
- **Range**: (-∞, ∞)  
- **Explanation**:
  - A modified version of ReLU that allows a small, non-zero gradient for negative inputs.
- **Advantages**:
  - Solves the dead neuron problem in ReLU.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Choice of \(\alpha\) affects performance and may require tuning.
- **Example**:
  - If \(x = -3\) and \(\alpha = 0.01\):  
    
    $f(-3) = 0.01 \cdot (-3) = -0.03$
      
    This small gradient helps the model learn from negative inputs.

### **5. Parametric ReLU (PReLU)**
- **Formula**:  
  
  $f(x) = 
  \begin{cases} 
  x & \text{if } x > 0 \\
  \alpha x & \text{if } x \leq 0
  \end{cases}$
  
  (\(\alpha\) is learned during training)
- **Range**: (-∞, ∞)  
- **Explanation**:
  - Similar to Leaky ReLU, but the slope of the negative part (\(\alpha\)) is learned dynamically.
- **Advantages**:
  - Adaptive to different datasets.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - May lead to overfitting for small datasets.
- **Example**:
  - If \(x = -2\) and the learned \(\alpha = 0.05\):  
    
    $f(-2) = 0.05 \cdot (-2) = -0.1$
    

---

### **6. Softmax**
- **Formula**:  
  
  $text{Softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^N e^{x_j}}$
  
- **Range**: (0, 1), with all outputs summing to 1.  
- **Explanation**:
  - Converts logits into probabilities for multi-class classification problems.
- **Advantages**:
  - Provides clear class probabilities.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Sensitive to outliers in logits.
- **Example**:
  - For class scores [2, 1, 0]:  
    
    $text{Softmax}(2) = \frac{e^2}{e^2 + e^1 + e^0} \approx 0.71$
      
    Class 1 has a 71% probability of being the correct class.

### **7. Swish**
- **Formula**:  
  
  $f(x) = x \cdot \sigma(x) = x \cdot \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$
  
- **Range**: (-∞, ∞)  
- **Explanation**:
  - A smooth, non-monotonic function that performs better than ReLU in some cases.
- **Advantages**:
  - Avoids the dead neuron problem and retains small gradients.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Computationally more expensive.
- **Example**:
  - If \(x = 2\):  
    
    $f(2) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{1 + e^{-2}} \approx 1.76$
    

---

### **8. ELU (Exponential Linear Unit)**
- **Formula**:  
  
  $f(x) = 
  \begin{cases} 
  x & \text{if } x > 0 \\
  \alpha(e^x - 1) & \text{if } x \leq 0
  \end{cases}$
  
  (\(\alpha\) is a hyperparameter, usually set to 1)
- **Range**: (-\(\alpha\), ∞)  
- **Explanation**:
  - Smooths the curve for negative inputs while retaining positive inputs.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces bias shift and vanishing gradient issues.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Computationally more expensive than ReLU.
- **Example**:
  - If $(x = -1\) and \(\alpha = 1\)$:  
    
    $f(-1) = 1(e^{-1} - 1) \approx -0.63$

2. **Discuss Pros and Cons**:
   - Highlight issues like vanishing gradients or computational efficiency.
3. **Provide Examples**:
   - Relate activation functions to specific domains, such as image recognition (ReLU) or sentiment analysis (Tanh).
