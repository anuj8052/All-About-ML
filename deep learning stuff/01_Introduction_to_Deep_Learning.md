# 01. Introduction to Deep Learning

## What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. It involves training these networks on large amounts of data to learn hierarchical representations of that data. This means that simpler features are learned at lower layers, and these are combined to form more complex features at higher layers.

## Relationship to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The broadest concept, aiming to create machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
*   **Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that allow computer systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing specific instructions for a task, ML algorithms are "trained" on data to find patterns and make predictions or decisions.
*   **Deep Learning (DL):** A specialized subset of ML that utilizes deep neural networks (neural networks with multiple layers) to learn complex patterns from large datasets.

## Brief History of Deep Learning

*   **1940s-1960s (Early Ideas):** Foundations were laid with McCulloch and Pitts' model of a neuron (1943) and Rosenblatt's Perceptron (1958), an early algorithm for supervised learning.
*   **1970s-1980s (AI Winter & Backpropagation):** Progress slowed due to limitations in computational power and the inability of simple perceptrons to solve complex problems (e.g., XOR problem). The backpropagation algorithm, crucial for training multi-layer networks, was popularized by Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams in 1986, though its roots go further back.
*   **1990s (Support Vector Machines & Convolutional Neural Networks):** Other ML techniques like SVMs gained popularity. Yann LeCun and colleagues developed LeNet-5, a pioneering Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition.
*   **2000s (The "Deep Learning" Rebrand & Challenges):** The term "Deep Learning" started to gain traction. Challenges like the vanishing gradient problem (where gradients become too small to effectively train deep networks) hindered progress.
*   **2006 Onwards (Breakthroughs):**
    *   Hinton, Osindero, and Teh introduced Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) with a layer-by-layer pre-training approach.
    *   Advancements in GPU hardware provided massive parallel processing capabilities.
    *   Availability of large labeled datasets (e.g., ImageNet).
*   **2012 (AlexNet):** AlexNet, a deep CNN, significantly outperformed other methods in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), marking a pivotal moment and igniting the current deep learning boom.

## Why is Deep Learning Popular Now?

Several factors have contributed to the recent surge in Deep Learning's popularity:

1.  **Data Availability:** The digital age has led to an explosion of data (images, text, videos, sensor data). Deep learning models thrive on large datasets to learn complex patterns.
2.  **Computational Power (GPUs):** Training deep neural networks is computationally intensive. The development of powerful Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), originally designed for gaming, provided the necessary parallel processing capabilities to train these models in a reasonable timeframe.
3.  **Algorithmic Advancements:** New activation functions (e.g., ReLU), better weight initialization techniques, regularization methods (e.g., Dropout), and improved optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam) have made it easier to train deeper and more complex networks.
4.  **Open Source Frameworks:** Tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and others have democratized access to deep learning, providing pre-built components and making it easier for researchers and developers to build and experiment with models.
5.  **Success Stories:** High-profile successes in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing (e.g., AlphaGo) have demonstrated the power of deep learning and fueled further investment and research.

## Key Concepts

### Neural Networks

Inspired by the biological brain, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a computational model consisting of interconnected processing units called **neurons** (or nodes). These neurons are typically organized in **layers**.

```

```

### Layers

*   **Input Layer:** Receives the initial data (features) for the network. No computation is performed here.
*   **Hidden Layers:** Perform computations and feature transformations. A network can have zero or more hidden layers. "Deep" in Deep Learning refers to having multiple hidden layers. Each neuron in a hidden layer receives inputs from the previous layer, performs a calculation, and passes the result to the next layer.
*   **Output Layer:** Produces the final result of the network (e.g., a classification score, a predicted value).

### Weights

Each connection between neurons has an associated **weight**. These weights are the primary parameters that the network learns during training. A weight determines the strength or importance of the connection. During forward propagation, the input to a neuron is multiplied by the weight of the connection.

### Biases

Each neuron (except in the input layer, typically) also has a **bias** term. The bias allows the activation function to be shifted to the left or right, which can be crucial for successful learning. It's an additional parameter that the network learns.

### Forward Propagation

This is the process of data flowing through the network from the input layer to the output layer.

1.  Input data is fed into the input layer.
2.  For each neuron in a subsequent layer:
    a.  Calculate a weighted sum of its inputs from the previous layer.
    b.  Add the bias term to this sum.
    c.  Apply an **activation function** (e.g., Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh) to the result. This introduces non-linearity, allowing the network to learn complex relationships.
    `output = activation_function( (input1 * weight1) + (input2 * weight2) + ... + bias )`
3.  The output of one layer becomes the input to the next, until the final output is produced by the output layer.

### Backward Propagation (Backpropagation)

This is the core algorithm used to train neural networks. It's how the network learns by adjusting its weights and biases.

1.  **Forward Pass:** Input data is passed through the network (forward propagation) to get an output.
2.  **Calculate Loss:** The network's output is compared to the actual target value (ground truth) using a **loss function** (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Cross-Entropy). The loss function quantifies how wrong the network's prediction is.
3.  **Backward Pass (Calculate Gradients):** The algorithm calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias in the network. The gradient indicates the direction and magnitude of change needed for each parameter to reduce the loss. This is done layer by layer, starting from the output layer and moving backward.
    *   This typically involves applying the chain rule of calculus.
4.  **Update Parameters:** The weights and biases are updated in the opposite direction of their gradients, scaled by a **learning rate**.
    `new_weight = old_weight - learning_rate * gradient_of_loss_wrt_weight`
5.  **Repeat:** Steps 1-4 are repeated for many iterations (epochs) over the training dataset until the network's performance is satisfactory.
