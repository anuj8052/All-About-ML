# 06. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs or ConvNets) are a class of deep neural networks that have become dominant in various computer vision tasks. They are specifically designed to process pixel data and are inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex.

## Introduction to CNNs

### Why CNNs? Limitations of Traditional NNs for Image Data

Traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) or Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) face significant challenges when applied directly to image data:

1.  **High Dimensionality (Curse of Dimensionality):**
    *   Images, even small ones, have a large number of pixels. For example, a 224x224 RGB image has `224 * 224 * 3 = 150,528` input features.
    *   If the first hidden layer of an MLP has, say, 1000 neurons, this would require `150,528 * 1000` weights for just the first layer. This leads to an enormous number of parameters.
    *   **Problems:**
        *   Computationally very expensive to train.
        *   Prone to overfitting due to the vast number of parameters compared to the number of training examples.

2.  **Spatial Structure Ignorance:**
    *   MLPs treat input features as a flat vector, losing the spatial relationships between pixels. For example, an MLP doesn't inherently understand that pixels close to each other are more related than pixels far apart.
    *   The local structure (edges, corners, textures) is crucial for image understanding, and MLPs fail to exploit this efficiently.

3.  **Lack of Translation Invariance:**
    *   If an object appears in a different location in an image, an MLP would need to learn to recognize it separately for each location. It doesn't generalize well to translated (shifted) objects.
    *   Ideally, a network should recognize an object regardless of where it appears in the image.

CNNs address these issues through specialized architectural features like local connectivity, parameter sharing, and pooling.

### Applications of CNNs

CNNs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide array of applications:

*   **Image Classification:** Assigning a label to an entire image (e.g., "cat," "dog," "car").
*   **Object Detection:** Identifying and locating multiple objects within an image by drawing bounding boxes around them and classifying them.
*   **Image Segmentation:**
    *   **Semantic Segmentation:** Classifying each pixel in an image to a particular class (e.g., all pixels belonging to a "car" get the same label).
    *   **Instance Segmentation:** Distinguishing between different instances of the same class (e.g., labeling "car1," "car2").
*   **Facial Recognition:** Identifying or verifying individuals from their facial images.
*   **Medical Image Analysis:** Detecting diseases, segmenting organs, or analyzing medical scans (X-rays, MRIs, CT scans).
*   **Self-Driving Cars:** For perception tasks like lane detection, traffic sign recognition, and pedestrian detection.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** While less common than RNNs or Transformers for sequential text, CNNs have been used for tasks like text classification by treating text as a 1D grid.
*   **Art Generation (Style Transfer):** Applying the artistic style of one image to the content of another.
*   **Video Analysis:** Extending 2D CNNs to 3D CNNs for action recognition or object tracking in videos.

## Core Components of CNNs

A typical CNN architecture consists of several key layers stacked together:

1.  **Convolutional Layer:** Extracts features from the input image.
2.  **Activation Layer:** Introduces non-linearity (usually ReLU).
3.  **Pooling Layer:** Reduces dimensionality and provides some translation invariance.
4.  **Fully Connected Layer:** Performs classification based on the extracted features.

### 1. Convolutional Layer

The convolutional layer is the core building block of a CNN. It applies a set of learnable filters (kernels) to the input image or feature maps from previous layers.

#### Filters (Kernels)

*   **Concept:** A filter is a small matrix of weights (e.g., 3x3, 5x5). It slides over the input image/feature map and performs a dot product at each position.
*   **Purpose:** Each filter is designed to detect a specific type of feature, such as edges, corners, textures, or more complex patterns in deeper layers. These weights are learned during the training process.
*   **Size (Kernel Size):** The dimensions of the filter (e.g., `height x width`). Common sizes are 3x3, 5x5, 7x7. Smaller filters capture local features, while larger filters can capture more global features.
*   **Depth (Number of Channels):**
    *   The depth of a filter must match the depth of its input. For example, if the input is an RGB image (depth 3), the filter will also have a depth of 3 (e.g., 3x3x3).
    *   A convolutional layer typically has multiple filters. Each filter produces a 2D output map called a **feature map** or **activation map**. If a layer has, say, 64 filters, it will produce 64 feature maps.
    ```
    Diagram: Input (e.g., 32x32x3) --Filter1 (5x5x3)--> Feature Map 1 (e.g., 28x28x1)
                                 --Filter2 (5x5x3)--> Feature Map 2 (e.g., 28x28x1)
                                 ...
                                 --FilterK (5x5x3)--> Feature Map K (e.g., 28x28x1)
    Resulting output volume: (e.g., 28x28xK)
    ```

#### Convolution Operation

The process of sliding the filter over the input and computing dot products is called convolution.

*   **Mathematical Operation:**
    For a 2D input `I` and a 2D filter `K` (assuming single channel for simplicity), the output `O` at position `(i, j)` is:
    `O(i, j) = Σ_m Σ_n I(i+m, j+n) * K(m, n)` (valid cross-correlation)
    Or, more commonly in deep learning frameworks, cross-correlation is used, which is equivalent if the filter is flipped:
    `O(i, j) = Σ_m Σ_n I(i-m, j-n) * K(m, n)` (convolution)
    In practice, deep learning libraries implement cross-correlation but call it convolution. The learning process adapts the filter weights, so the distinction is often not critical.

    If the input has depth `D_in` (e.g., 3 for RGB), and the filter also has depth `D_in`, the operation for one filter producing one feature map is:
    `O(i, j) = Σ_d Σ_m Σ_n I(i+m, j+n, d) * K(m, n, d) + b`
    where `b` is a bias term for that filter.

*   **Stride:**
    *   The stride `S` defines how many pixels the filter moves at each step when sliding across the input.
    *   A stride of 1 means the filter moves one pixel at a time. A stride of 2 means it moves two pixels at a time.
    *   Larger strides result in smaller output feature maps.
    *   `Output_size = (Input_size - Filter_size) / Stride + 1` (assuming no padding)

*   **Padding:**
    *   Padding refers to adding extra pixels (usually zeros) around the border of the input image or feature map.
    *   **Purpose:**
        1.  **Preserve Spatial Dimensions:** Without padding, the output feature map is smaller than the input. Repeated convolutions would rapidly shrink the dimensions. "Same" padding aims to keep the output size the same as the input size (for stride 1).
        2.  **Improve Performance at Borders:** Filters can be applied more effectively to pixels at the edges of the input.
    *   **"Valid" Padding (No Padding):** The filter is only applied to positions where it fully overlaps with the input. Output size shrinks.
    *   **"Same" Padding:** Sufficient zero padding is added so that the output feature map has the same spatial dimensions as the input (when stride=1).
        `P = (Filter_size - 1) / 2` for same padding (if stride=1).
        `Output_size = (Input_size - Filter_size + 2 * Padding) / Stride + 1`

#### Feature Maps

*   Each filter in a convolutional layer produces a 2D feature map.
*   This map highlights the regions in the input where the specific feature detected by the filter is present. For example, a filter trained to detect vertical edges will have high activations in its feature map where vertical edges appear in the input.
*   The stack of feature maps (one from each filter) forms the output volume of the convolutional layer.

#### Local Connectivity

*   Unlike fully connected layers where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer, neurons in a convolutional layer are only connected to a small, local region of the input (the **receptive field**).
*   The size of this receptive field is determined by the filter size.
*   This exploits the spatial locality of image data – pixels that are close together are more likely to be related.

#### Parameter Sharing

*   A crucial concept in CNNs: the same filter (set of weights and a bias) is used across all spatial locations in the input.
*   **Benefits:**
    1.  **Drastic Reduction in Parameters:** Instead of learning separate weights for each location, only one set of weights per filter is learned. For example, a 5x5 filter has 25 weights (+1 bias), regardless of the input image size. This makes CNNs much more efficient than MLPs for images.
    2.  **Translation Invariance:** If a filter learns to detect a pattern (e.g., an eye), it can detect that pattern wherever it appears in the image because the same filter is applied everywhere.

### 2. Pooling Layer (Subsampling)

Pooling layers are typically inserted between successive convolutional layers in a CNN architecture.

*   **Purpose:**
    1.  **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the feature maps, thereby reducing the number of parameters and computations in subsequent layers. This also helps control overfitting.
    2.  **Translation Invariance (Local):** Makes the representations somewhat invariant to small translations in the input. If the feature shifts slightly, the pooled output tends to remain similar.

*   **Operation:**
    *   Pooling is applied independently to each feature map (depth-wise).
    *   A pooling window (e.g., 2x2) slides over the feature map, and a statistical summary of the values within the window is computed.

*   **Types of Pooling:**
    *   **Max Pooling:**
        *   Selects the maximum value from the pooling window.
        *   `Output(x,y) = max(Input_region(x,y))`
        *   Most common type of pooling. It effectively captures the most prominent features.
        ```
        Diagram: Max Pooling
        Input Feature Map Patch (e.g., 2x2):  | 1  5 |
                                             | 2  3 |
        Output (single value): 5
        ```
    *   **Average Pooling:**
        *   Calculates the average value within the pooling window.
        *   `Output(x,y) = average(Input_region(x,y))`
        *   Less common than max pooling for general vision tasks, but used in some architectures (e.g., global average pooling at the end of a network).

*   **Parameters:**
    *   **Pool Size (F):** The size of the pooling window (e.g., 2x2).
    *   **Stride (S):** How many pixels the window moves at each step. Often, stride is equal to pool size (e.g., 2x2 window with stride 2) to create non-overlapping pooling regions, reducing the feature map size by a factor of S.
    *   `Output_size = (Input_size - Pool_size) / Stride + 1`

*   **No Learnable Parameters:** Pooling layers do not have any learnable parameters (weights or biases). They perform a fixed operation.

### 3. Fully Connected Layer (Dense Layer)

*   **Role:** After several convolutional and pooling layers, the high-level features extracted are flattened into a 1D vector. This vector is then fed into one or more fully connected layers.
*   **Function:** These layers perform classification based on the learned features. Each neuron in a fully connected layer is connected to all activations in the previous layer, similar to traditional MLPs.
*   **Output Layer:** The final fully connected layer typically has a softmax activation function for multi-class classification, producing a probability distribution over the classes. For regression tasks, it might have a linear activation.
    ```

    ```

## CNN Architectures

Several influential CNN architectures have marked significant milestones in computer vision:

### LeNet-5 (Yann LeCun et al., 1998)

*   **Pioneering Work:** One of the earliest successful CNNs, primarily designed for handwritten digit recognition (MNIST dataset).
*   **Architecture:**
    1.  Input (32x32 grayscale image)
    2.  Conv1: 6 filters (5x5), stride 1. Output: 28x28x6.
    3.  Activation: tanh or sigmoid.
    4.  Pool1: Average pooling, filter size 2x2, stride 2. Output: 14x14x6.
    5.  Conv2: 16 filters (5x5), stride 1. Output: 10x10x16.
    6.  Activation: tanh or sigmoid.
    7.  Pool2: Average pooling, filter size 2x2, stride 2. Output: 5x5x16.
    8.  Flatten: Output 5*5*16 = 400 units.
    9.  FC1: 120 units. Activation: tanh.
    10. FC2: 84 units. Activation: tanh.
    11. Output Layer (FC3): 10 units (for digits 0-9) with softmax (or RBF units in original).
*   **Significance:** Demonstrated the power of stacking convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction.

### AlexNet (Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey Hinton, 2012)

*   **Breakthrough:** Won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012 by a large margin, igniting the deep learning revolution in computer vision.
*   **Key Innovations:**
    1.  **ReLU Activation:** Used ReLU (`max(0, x)`) instead of sigmoid/tanh, which trained much faster and helped mitigate vanishing gradients.
    2.  **Dropout:** Used in fully connected layers to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping neurons during training.
    3.  **Data Augmentation:** Expanded the training dataset by applying transformations like image translations, horizontal reflections, and patch extractions.
    4.  **Training on Multiple GPUs:** Due to the large model size and dataset.
    5.  **Local Response Normalization (LRN):** A technique (less used now) to encourage competition among neuron activations.
*   **Architecture (Simplified):**
    *   Larger and deeper than LeNet.
    *   Input (227x227x3 RGB image)
    *   Conv1 (96 filters, 11x11, stride 4) -> ReLU -> MaxPool -> LRN
    *   Conv2 (256 filters, 5x5, padding 2) -> ReLU -> MaxPool -> LRN
    *   Conv3 (384 filters, 3x3, padding 1) -> ReLU
    *   Conv4 (384 filters, 3x3, padding 1) -> ReLU
    *   Conv5 (256 filters, 3x3, padding 1) -> ReLU -> MaxPool
    *   Flatten
    *   FC1 (4096 units) -> ReLU -> Dropout
    *   FC2 (4096 units) -> ReLU -> Dropout
    *   Output Layer (FC3): 1000 units (ImageNet classes) with softmax.

### VGGNets (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014)

*   **Key Idea: Depth and Simplicity:** Showed that very deep networks could achieve excellent performance using a simple, uniform architecture.
*   **Architecture:**
    *   Used very small (3x3) convolutional filters exclusively. Stacking multiple 3x3 filters can replicate the receptive field of larger filters (e.g., two 3x3 layers have an effective receptive field of 5x5) but with more non-linearity and fewer parameters.
    *   Max pooling layers (2x2, stride 2).
    *   Increased depth by adding more convolutional layers (VGG-16 and VGG-19 are common variants, having 16 and 19 weight layers respectively).
    *   Followed by three fully connected layers.
*   **Impact:** Easy to understand and implement. The deep stacks of small filters became a common design pattern. However, very deep VGGs are computationally expensive and have many parameters.

### GoogLeNet (Inception) (Szegedy et al., Google, 2014)

*   **Key Idea: Computational Efficiency and Multi-Scale Processing:** Won ILSVRC 2014. Focused on building deeper networks that were also computationally efficient.
*   **Inception Module:**
    *   The core component of GoogLeNet.
    *   Applies multiple filter sizes (e.g., 1x1, 3x3, 5x5 convolutions) and max pooling in parallel to the same input feature map.
    *   The outputs of these parallel branches are then concatenated depth-wise.
    *   This allows the network to capture features at different scales simultaneously.
    *   **1x1 Convolutions (Bottleneck Layers):** Used extensively within Inception modules to reduce the depth (number of channels) of feature maps before applying more expensive 3x3 or 5x5 convolutions, significantly reducing computation.
    ```
    Diagram: Inception Module
    Input
      |-----> 1x1 Conv -----> Output1
      |-----> 1x1 Conv (bottleneck) -> 3x3 Conv -----> Output2
      |-----> 1x1 Conv (bottleneck) -> 5x5 Conv -----> Output3
      |-----> MaxPool -> 1x1 Conv (projection) ----> Output4
    Output = Concatenate(Output1, Output2, Output3, Output4)
    ```
*   **Architecture:** Stacked Inception modules. Also used global average pooling at the end instead of large fully connected layers, drastically reducing parameters. Had auxiliary classifiers in intermediate layers during training to help with vanishing gradients.

### ResNet (Residual Networks) (He et al., Microsoft Research, 2015)

*   **Key Idea: Solving Vanishing Gradients in Very Deep Networks:** Won ILSVRC 2015. Enabled training of extremely deep networks (e.g., 50, 101, 152 layers, or even 1000+ layers) by introducing **residual learning** via **skip connections**.
*   **The Degradation Problem:** Deeper plain networks (without skip connections) often performed worse than shallower networks, not due to overfitting but because they were harder to optimize (vanishing gradients made it difficult for earlier layers to learn).
*   **Residual Block (Skip Connection):**
    *   Instead of learning a direct mapping `H(x)` from input `x` to output, the network learns a **residual mapping** `F(x) = H(x) - x`.
    *   The output of the block is then `H(x) = F(x) + x`.
    *   This is implemented using a "skip connection" or "shortcut" that bypasses one or more layers and adds the input `x` directly to the output of the stacked layers `F(x)`.
    ```
    Diagram: Residual Block
        Input (x)
          |    \
          |  [Weight Layer (Conv)]
          |  [Activation (ReLU)]
          |  [Weight Layer (Conv)]
          |    /
          + (add)
          |
        Output (F(x) + x)
    ```
*   **Impact:**
    *   Made it much easier to train very deep networks. The identity mapping (skip connection) provides a direct path for gradients to flow back through the network.
    *   If a layer is not useful, its weights `F(x)` can be driven to zero, and the block simply learns an identity mapping, making it easier for deeper models to be at least as good as shallower ones.
    *   ResNets became a standard for many computer vision tasks.

### (Optional) Brief Mentions:

*   **DenseNet (Densely Connected Convolutional Networks):** Each layer is connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion within a dense block. Feature maps are concatenated. Encourages feature reuse and strengthens gradient flow.
*   **EfficientNet:** Systematically scales up network depth, width, and resolution using a compound scaling method to achieve better efficiency and accuracy.

## Understanding CNNs

### Hierarchical Feature Learning

A key characteristic of CNNs is their ability to learn a hierarchy of features automatically from the data:

*   **Early Layers (near the input):** Learn to detect simple, low-level features like edges, corners, color blobs, and simple textures.
*   **Middle Layers:** Combine these low-level features to learn more complex patterns and object parts, such as circles, squares, more complex textures, parts of faces (noses, eyes), or parts of objects (wheels, doors).
*   **Later Layers (deeper in the network):** Combine these mid-level features to detect even more abstract and complex patterns, eventually representing entire objects or scenes.

This hierarchical structure mimics how the human visual system is thought to process information.

### Visualization of CNN Filters and Feature Maps

Understanding what a CNN has learned can be aided by visualization techniques:

*   **Visualizing Filters:**
    *   Filters in the first convolutional layer can often be directly visualized as small image patches. They typically show patterns for detecting edges, colors, or simple textures.
    *   Visualizing filters in deeper layers is more challenging as they respond to more abstract patterns in the feature maps of previous layers, not directly in image space.
*   **Visualizing Feature Maps (Activations):**
    *   Given an input image, one can inspect the output feature maps of different layers.
    *   A feature map shows which parts of the input image activate a particular filter. For example, a filter trained to detect faces might show high activations in its feature map where faces appear in the input image.
*   **Other Techniques:** Techniques like saliency maps (highlighting important pixels for a prediction), class activation mapping (CAM), and t-SNE embeddings of features can also provide insights.

## Training CNNs

Training CNNs involves the same general principles as training other neural networks (backpropagation, gradient descent variants), but with some specific considerations for image data.

### Data Augmentation

Data augmentation is crucial for training robust CNNs, especially when the training dataset is limited. It involves applying various transformations to the training images to create new, synthetic training samples.

*   **Common Techniques for Images:**
    *   **Flipping:** Horizontal flips are very common. Vertical flips might be used if vertically symmetric objects are expected.
    *   **Rotation:** Rotating images by a small angle.
    *   **Scaling/Zooming:** Zooming in or out.
    *   **Cropping:** Randomly cropping sections of the image.
    *   **Translation (Shifting):** Shifting the image horizontally or vertically.
    *   **Shearing:** Tilting the image.
    *   **Color Jittering:** Adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue.
    *   **Adding Noise:** Adding Gaussian noise.
    *   **Cutout/Random Erasing:** Masking out random rectangular regions of the image to make the model more robust to occlusions.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Increases the effective size of the training dataset.
    *   Helps the model generalize better to unseen data by making it invariant to these transformations.
    *   Reduces overfitting.

### Transfer Learning with Pre-trained CNNs

Training very deep CNNs from scratch requires a large amount of labeled data and significant computational resources. Transfer learning is a powerful technique to overcome this.

*   **Concept:** Use a CNN model that has been pre-trained on a very large dataset (e.g., ImageNet, which has millions of images and 1000 classes). This pre-trained model has already learned a rich hierarchy of features relevant to visual recognition.
*   **How it Works:**
    1.  **Feature Extraction:** Take the pre-trained CNN and remove its original classification layer (the final fully connected layer). Use the remaining convolutional base as a fixed feature extractor. Pass your new dataset through this base, and use the output features to train a new, smaller classifier (e.g., a few fully connected layers) for your specific task. This is useful when your dataset is small.
    2.  **Fine-Tuning:** In addition to replacing the classifier, you can also fine-tune the weights of some of the later layers of the pre-trained convolutional base. Earlier layers (which learn generic features like edges) are often kept frozen, while later layers (which learn more task-specific features) are allowed to adapt to the new dataset. This is useful when your dataset is larger or more similar to the original pre-training dataset.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Achieve high performance with much smaller datasets.
    *   Faster training times compared to training from scratch.
    *   Leverages knowledge learned from massive datasets.

// compile_and_train(my_cnn, training_data, validation_data)
```
