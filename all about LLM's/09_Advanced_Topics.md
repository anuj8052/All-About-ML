# Advanced Topics in LLMs

## Mixture of Experts (MoE)

Mixture of Experts (MoE) is a technique for improving the performance of LLMs by using multiple "expert" models to process different parts of the input sequence. This can be a very effective way to improve the performance of a model on a new task, especially if the new task has a small amount of training data.

## Quantization

Quantization is a technique for reducing the size of an LLM by representing the weights of the model with a lower precision. This can be a very effective way to reduce the memory footprint of a model and to make it more efficient to run on mobile devices.

## Sparse Attention

Sparse attention is a technique for reducing the computational complexity of the attention mechanism by only attending to a subset of the words in the input sequence. This can be a very effective way to improve the performance of a model on long sequences of text.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique for improving the performance of LLMs by allowing them to access an external knowledge base. This can be a very effective way to improve the performance of a model on tasks that require a lot of factual knowledge, such as question answering.
