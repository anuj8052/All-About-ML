# Training LLMs

## How are LLMs Trained?

LLMs are trained on massive amounts of text data. The training process can be divided into two main stages:

*   **Pre-training:** In this stage, the model is trained on a general-purpose dataset of text, such as Wikipedia or a large corpus of books. The goal of pre-training is to teach the model the general patterns of language.
*   **Fine-tuning:** In this stage, the model is trained on a smaller, more specific dataset of text. The goal of fine-tuning is to adapt the model to a specific task, such as machine translation or text summarization.

## Pre-training Objectives

There are a number of different pre-training objectives that can be used to train LLMs. Some of the most common include:

*   **Masked language modeling (MLM):** In this objective, some of the words in the input sequence are masked, and the model is trained to predict the masked words.
*   **Next sentence prediction (NSP):** In this objective, the model is given two sentences and is trained to predict whether the second sentence is the next sentence in the original text.
*   **Causal language modeling (CLM):** In this objective, the model is trained to predict the next word in a sequence of text. This is the objective used by GPT-3.

## Fine-tuning Objectives

The fine-tuning objective will depend on the specific task that the model is being trained for. For example, if the model is being trained for machine translation, the fine-tuning objective will be to minimize the difference between the model's output and the ground truth translation.

If the model is being trained for text summarization, the fine-tuning objective will be to maximize the ROUGE score, which is a metric for evaluating the quality of summaries.
