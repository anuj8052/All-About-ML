# Embeddings

## What are Embeddings?

In the context of LLMs, embeddings are a way of representing words, phrases, or even entire documents as vectors of real numbers. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text, so that words with similar meanings are located close to each other in the vector space.

For example, the words "king" and "queen" would be located close to each other in the vector space, while the words "king" and "apple" would be located far apart.

## How are Embeddings Created?

Embeddings are typically learned by training a neural network on a large corpus of text. The neural network learns to predict the context of a word, and the embeddings are the weights of the neural network.

There are a number of different algorithms that can be used to create embeddings, but some of the most common include:

*   **Word2Vec:** This algorithm learns to predict the context of a word by looking at the words that appear before and after it.
*   **GloVe:** This algorithm learns to predict the context of a word by looking at the co-occurrence of words in a large corpus of text.
*   **BERT:** This algorithm learns to predict the context of a word by looking at the words that appear before and after it, as well as the words that appear in the same sentence.

## Why are Embeddings Important?

Embeddings are important because they allow LLMs to understand the meaning of text. This is essential for a variety of tasks, such as:

*   **Machine translation:** LLMs can use embeddings to translate text from one language to another by finding the closest embedding in the target language.
*   **Text summarization:** LLMs can use embeddings to summarize long pieces of text by identifying the most important sentences and phrases.
*   **Question answering:** LLMs can use embeddings to answer questions about a given text by finding the most relevant sentences and phrases.
