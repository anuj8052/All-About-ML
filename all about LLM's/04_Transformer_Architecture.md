# Transformer Architecture

## What is the Transformer Architecture?

The Transformer architecture is a neural network architecture that was introduced in the 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need". It has since become the foundation of most modern LLMs, such as BERT and GPT-3.

The Transformer architecture is composed of two main components:

*   **An encoder:** The encoder takes as input a sequence of text and outputs a sequence of embeddings.
*   **A decoder:** The decoder takes as input the embeddings from the encoder and outputs a sequence of text.

## How does the Transformer Architecture Work?

The Transformer architecture works by using the attention mechanism to learn long-range dependencies in the data. The attention mechanism allows the model to pay attention to specific parts of the input sequence when processing it, rather than treating all parts of the sequence equally.

The encoder and decoder are both composed of a stack of identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers:

*   **A multi-head self-attention mechanism:** This sub-layer allows the model to pay attention to different parts of the input sequence at the same time.
*   **A position-wise fully connected feed-forward network:** This sub-layer applies a non-linear transformation to the output of the multi-head self-attention mechanism.

## Why is the Transformer Architecture Important?

The Transformer architecture is important because it is much more efficient than previous architectures for processing sequential data, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This is because the Transformer architecture can process the entire input sequence at once, while RNNs have to process the input sequence one word at a time.

This makes the Transformer architecture much better suited for training on large datasets of text, which is essential for building powerful LLMs.
