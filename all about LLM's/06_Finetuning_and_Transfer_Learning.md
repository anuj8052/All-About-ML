# Fine-tuning and Transfer Learning

## What is Fine-tuning?

Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained LLM and adapting it to a specific task. This is done by training the model on a smaller, more specific dataset of text.

For example, if you want to build a chatbot that can answer questions about your company's products, you would fine-tune a pre-trained LLM on a dataset of your company's product documentation.

## What is Transfer Learning?

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model that has been trained on one task is used as a starting point for a model that is being trained on a different task.

In the context of LLMs, transfer learning is used to transfer the knowledge that a pre-trained LLM has learned about language to a new task. This can be a very effective way to improve the performance of a model on a new task, especially if the new task has a small amount of training data.

## Why are Fine-tuning and Transfer Learning Important?

Fine-tuning and transfer learning are important because they allow us to build powerful LLMs for a wide variety of tasks without having to train a new model from scratch for each task. This saves a lot of time and resources, and it also allows us to build models for tasks that have a small amount of training data.
