### **1. Data Analyst at Chordify Inc.**  
#### **Question: How did you integrate and optimize BigQuery for regular reporting on GCP?**  

**For a Technical Audience:**  
- **S:** I optimized the execution of queries in BigQuery for Chordify's reporting needs.  
- **T:** Queries were slow due to large datasets, improper use of joins, and lack of table partitioning.  
- **A:**  
  - Partitioned tables by time, reducing query scans for historical data.  
  - Implemented clustering to optimize filtering on frequently queried fields like product IDs.  
  - Rewrote queries using standard SQL functions and pushed computation to BigQuery instead of client-side processing.  
  - Automated query execution using Cloud Scheduler with scheduled SQL jobs for daily, weekly, and monthly reporting.  
- **R:** These changes cut query execution time by 40%, with a 25% reduction in GCP compute costs.  

**For a Non-Technical Audience:**  
- I streamlined our reporting process on Google Cloud by making our queries faster and more efficient.  
- By organizing our data better and automating reports, we delivered real-time insights, saving both time and costs.

### **2. Research Assistant at IIM Mumbai – Cement Demand Forecasting**  
#### **Question: How did you ensure robustness across regions, districts, and dealers in your demand forecasting model?**  

**For a Technical Audience:**  
- **S:** Demand forecasting required models to perform consistently across three levels of granularity.  
- **T:** I needed to develop a robust model pipeline to handle varying data quality and distribution across these levels.  
- **A:**  
  - Standardized features like seasonal indices and lagged demand variables for consistency.  
  - Segmented the training data by hierarchy (region, district, dealer) and applied tailored preprocessing pipelines.  
  - Used ensemble stacking with base models (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest) and a meta-model (XGBoost) for aggregation.  
  - Validated results using time-series cross-validation to assess stability under different data splits.  
- **R:** Achieved low MAPEs of 6.7% for regions, 19.75% for districts, and 27.90% for dealers, improving decision-making accuracy.  

**For a Non-Technical Audience:**  
- I created a forecasting model to predict cement demand accurately across different levels—regions, districts, and dealers.  
- By cleaning and structuring the data effectively and using advanced prediction techniques, we provided the company with highly reliable forecasts, improving inventory planning and reducing costs.

### **3. Video Analytics for the FMCG Company**  
#### **Question: How did you improve object detection performance using YOLOv8?**  

**For a Technical Audience:**  
- **S:** Object detection was key for analyzing washing videos, but the initial YOLOv8 implementation struggled with precision.  
- **T:** My task was to optimize detection accuracy for a custom dataset with challenging objects.  
- **A:**  
  - Augmented training data with techniques like rotation, brightness adjustments, and noise injection to simulate diverse conditions.  
  - Fine-tuned YOLOv8’s hyperparameters, including anchor sizes, learning rate, and batch size.  
  - Integrated early stopping in the training process to avoid overfitting.  
  - Used mAP (mean Average Precision) at different IoU thresholds (mAP50-90) to evaluate model performance.  
- **R:** Achieved a final mAP of 89%, enabling precise identification of objects and washing stages, which improved process automation.  

**For a Non-Technical Audience:**  
- I enhanced a system to analyze washing videos by training it to recognize specific objects and stages accurately.  
- By refining the data and tweaking the system settings, it performed with 89% accuracy, helping the company automate and improve their processes.

### **4. Hate Speech Detection Project**  
#### **Question: How did you address biases in the hate speech detection model?**  

**For a Technical Audience:**  
- **S:** Sentiment analysis models exhibited bias against disability-related content, often labeling neutral statements as toxic.  
- **T:** I was tasked with mitigating this bias while maintaining overall accuracy.  
- **A:**  
  - Collected a custom dataset emphasizing fairness by including diverse and balanced examples.  
  - Fine-tuned a pre-trained BERT model using adversarial training to make it robust against biased patterns.  
  - Evaluated fairness metrics (e.g., Equal Opportunity Difference) alongside standard accuracy measures.  
  - Used SHAP values to interpret and visualize model predictions, ensuring it made unbiased decisions.  
- **R:** Reduced false positives in disability-related content while maintaining an 80% overall classification accuracy.  

**For a Non-Technical Audience:**  
- I improved a system to detect hate speech by ensuring it treated all types of content fairly, especially disability-related topics.  
- By using balanced training data and refining how the system made decisions, we achieved reliable results with minimal bias.

### **5. General Approach to Debugging Underperforming ML Models**  
**For a Technical Audience:**  
- **A:**  
  1. Checked for data issues, such as missing values, imbalanced classes, and irrelevant features.  
  2. Used permutation importance and SHAP values to understand feature relevance.  
  3. Tweaked hyperparameters using grid/random search.  
  4. Experimented with alternative model architectures and ensemble techniques to improve performance.  
  5. Monitored overfitting or underfitting using learning curves.  

**For a Non-Technical Audience:**  
- I start by ensuring the data is clean and properly structured, then fine-tune the system’s settings to improve performance.  
- If needed, I test different techniques to ensure the system delivers the most accurate results.
